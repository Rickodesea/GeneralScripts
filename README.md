# Python Scripts for General Use
Python 3 Scripts for General Use.

Major scripts are found in the [MajorScripts](MajorScripts) folder.  They are kept in their own folder.
Major scripts are the most powerful scripts.
Examples of major scripts are:

* [MajorScripts/BinaryToCArray](MajorScripts/BinaryToCArray)
* [MajorScripts/CenterText](MajorScripts/CenterText)
* [MajorScripts/TextToCComment](MajorScripts/TextToCComment)
* [MajorScripts/TextToCString](MajorScripts/TextToCString)

Minor scripts are kept in the [MinorScripts](MinorScripts) folder.  They are small and solve very small problems.

Both major and minor scripts are available for use to solve a wide range of problems.

Call [run.sh](run.sh) to run all the tests.
